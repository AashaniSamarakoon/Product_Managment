# Full-Stack Product Management Application

A modern web application built with React frontend and Node.js backend for user authentication and product CRUD operations.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login/register with JWT tokens
- **Product Management**: Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- **Modern UI**: Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- **Input Validation**: Client and server-side validation with user feedback
- **Protected Routes**: Authentication required for CRUD operations
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant feedback for all operations

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React 18 with Vite for fast development
- Tailwind CSS for modern styling
- Axios for HTTP requests
- React Context API for state management

### Backend
- Node.js with Express.js
- JWT authentication
- bcryptjs for password hashing
- In-memory data storage (easily replaceable with database)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
